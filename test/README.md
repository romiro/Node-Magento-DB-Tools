Unit Tests with Mocha
=====================
The easiest way I currently know of to run these tests is to create a new Run profile for Mocha tests, using this
directory as a location.


Test cases to consider

- When connecting using a password, and the key is NOT installed on the server, what happens?

- When connecting using a password, but the key IS installed on the server, what happens?
